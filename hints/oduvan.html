    <div class="question">
        Is the game free?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, you can play the game for free. But there are some limitations for free accounts. Some missions on the islands can be blocked. Also, the access to the other users’ solutions leaderboard will begin with Random Review, when you, as a user, must first randomly review the solutions of other users, before you’ll find the best ones.</p>

        <p>You can <a href="/purchases/become-awesome/">buy an Awesome account</a> at any time. We have a monthly, semi-annual and annual payment plans for you. This will help us develop this and other coding games we’re working on.</p>

        Can I play with friends?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, and it’s always better to do with friends. Starting at the 3rd level there is an Activity section, which resembles a news feed in social networks (Every user’s profile has “follow” button). On the Activity page you can follow your friends and see their new solutions and comments. In addition to this the solutions in leaderboard you can filter by solutions that are published by your friends or that your friends like.</p>

    <div class="question">
        I don’t quite like using the in-browser code editor. Does CheckiO have any alternatives?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. We have a CheckiO Console Client for Linux, Mac and Windows. You can also install a browser plugin (Chrome or FireFox) in conjunction with it to synchronize the code editor with files on a local disk.

    <div class="question">
        You’ve mentioned the possibility of creating a mission, didn’t you?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, starting at the 9th level CheckiO users can create missions themselves and share them with the community for review. <a href="/blog/once-again-you-can-create-missions-on-checkio/">This article</a> in detail will describe the process of mission creation. But even before that you can always help by improving the already existing  missions, adding tips, translations, correcting typos. You can also read about this in a <a href="/blog/how-to-improve-checkio-missions/">separate article</a>.</p>
